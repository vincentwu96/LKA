<Legend>English Writing</Legend>

<p>My program has two main emphases:</p>
<p>Learn by doing and Variety.</p>
<p>What I mean by Learn by Doing is that since all writing is creative and subjective, by putting many rules on how students write, it kills the creative process. Therefore, rather than kill student creativity with oppressive rules, I simply stimulate students' minds with unusual ideas and student-friendly topics, give them a simple format to follow, and tell them to write. I do offer students ways to improve their writing, but if I force them to use my suggestions, their writing becomes fake and contrived, so I don't insist on it. I'm all about watching as students' writing grows organically. It's a slow process but it happens. I'm also a big believer in re-writes. They are important not just to make an essay polished and complete, but for students' self-confidence.</p>
<p>As far as Variety, I like to give students different types of assignments-reading comprehension, vocabulary and grammar - to prevent boredom from developing. I'm especially fond of reading comprehension because studies have shown that the best way to improve writing is to read professional writing - both fiction and non-fiction. Knowing this, I search out the most interesting, unusual and compelling stories for students to read so that they read professional writing with an active reading mindset, and in the process, mentally absorb a great writer's unique style. It is true that vocabulary exercises are not as closely related to improving writing as reading comprehension, but there have been many times when students have told me they really enjoy reading the stories at the end of each vocabulary chapter, and learning new words is part of the process of building confidence in language, so I continue assigning vocabulary.</p>
<p>An area that I may experiment with during the 2017-18 school year is reading classic novels and writing literary essays on them. Usually, I save that for the summer, but several parents have asked me to do this during the school year, so I am reconsidering. I hope you better understand my program after reading these paragraphs.</p>
