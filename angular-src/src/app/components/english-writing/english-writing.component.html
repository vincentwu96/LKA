	<title>English Writing</title>
	<h2 class="page-header">English Writing</h2>

	<p>My program has two main emphases:</p>
	<p>Learn by doing and Variety.</p>

	<p>What I mean by Learn by Doing is that since all writing is creative and subjective, I stimulate students' minds with student-friendly topics, give them a simple format to follow, and tell them to write. I do offer students ways to improve their writing, but I don't expect them to write exactly the same way as I do because I want  students' writing to grow organically and not artificially. It's a slow process but it happens. I'm also a big believer in re-writes. They are important,  not just to make an essay polished and complete, but for students' self-confidence.</p>

	<p>As far as Variety, I like to give students different types of assignments, such as reading comprehension, vocabulary and grammar. Reading comprehension is important because many studies have shown that one of the best ways to improve student writing is to read professional writing - both fiction and non-fiction-regularly.  Knowing this, I search out compelling stories for students to read so that they absorb a great writer's unique writing style. I am also using  new writing exercises this year that will push students to write with better sentence variety and better paragraph coherence and flow.  Vocabulary development is also very important; I expect students to complete at least one vocabulary chapter per week.  Last, I also assign periodic grammar exercises because students don't receive enough grammar instruction in school and knowledge of the rules of  grammar is a very important part of creating well-written essays.</p>
