		<h3>The Best of Both Western and Eastern Cultures</h3>
		<p>In both cultures we recognize the importance of building up good habits for life, thus, we prioritize our student's ability to retain good habits. Additionally, to integrate Western Culture, we cultivate leadership throughout our daily activities. Because of our Eastern influence, we also emphasize building our student's emotional intelligence.</p>
