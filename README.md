LKA

This website was coded for the company, Light of Knowledge Academy, using the MEAN stack which is comprised of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js.
In addition to the front-end, the back-end allows users to create accounts if they enter valid information. They can then log in and view their empty log of grades.
Instructors can then update any given user's grades through the database.
