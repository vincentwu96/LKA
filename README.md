LKA

This website was coded for Light of Knowledge Academy using the MEAN stack which is comprised of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js.
The front end features responsive CSS design allowing for both desktop and mobile use. The back end features registration authentication,
login authentication, and password encryption. Students and their parents are able to create accounts after providing valid registration
information. The account features a profile that displays grades for students enrolled in a current term. Instructors can update any
user's grades through mLab, a database as a service for MongoDB.
