LKA

This website was coded for the company, Light of Knowledge Academy, using the MEAN stack which is comprised of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js.
In addition to the displaying company info on the front-end, the back-end allows users to create accounts if they enter valid registration information.
After an account has been created, they can log in and view their (empty) log of grades under their profile.
Instructors can then update any given user's grades through the database.
