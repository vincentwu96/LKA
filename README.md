LKA

This website was coded for Light of Knowledge Academy using the MEAN stack which is comprised of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js.
In addition to the displaying course info on the front-end, the back-end allows users to create accounts if they enter valid registration information.
Passwords are encrypted for user safety. After an account has been created, they can log in and view their (empty) log of grades under their profile.
Instructors can then update any given user's grades through the database.
